# MockPlatform

This is NOT part of the public platform. It is a testbed for the DSS Catalogue and metadata API and the Weather data API. It's just a very simple HTML/JavaScript client that tries to make sense of the information from the APIs and use them.

Make a copy of js/local_settings_sample.js to js/local_settings.js and adapt to your local needs. The web services are publicly available here: https://ipmdecisions.nibio.no/DSSService/ and https://ipmdecisions.nibio.no/WeatherService/. They might not be completely in sync with the client, though. Users are encouraged to install their own versions, using the source code from: https://github.com/H2020-IPM-Decisions/DSSService and https://github.com/H2020-IPM-Decisions/WeatherService
